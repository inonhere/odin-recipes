    <h2>Burgers that taste like hamburgers, but without meat! 
        You can replace the Cheddar cheese with Monterey Jack or 
        any other cheese you like. If you prefer, you may use a 1.4 
        ounce packet of brown broth in place of the soy sauce.</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil.</li>
        <li>1 small onion, grated.</li>
        <li>2 cloves crushed garlic.</li>
        <li>2 carrots, shredded.</li>
        <li>1 small summer squash, shredded.</li>
        <li>1 small zucchini, shredded.</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups rolled oats.</li>
        <li>¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten.</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce.</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a skillet over low heat, 
            and cook the onion and garlic for about 5 minutes, until tender. 
            Mix in the carrots, squash, and zucchini. Continue to cook and 
            stir for 2 minutes. Remove pan from heat, and mix in oats, 
            cheese, and egg. Stir in soy sauce, transfer the mixture to 
             bowl, and refrigerate 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the grill for high heat.</li>
        <li>Place the flour on a large plate. Form the vegetable mixture into eight 3 inch round patties. 
            Drop each patty into the flour, lightly coating both sides.</li>
        
        <li>
            Oil the grill grate, and grill patties 5 minutes on each side, or 
            until heated through and nicely browned.
        </li>
    </ol>
